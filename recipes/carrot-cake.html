        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carrot cake is a moist, dense spice cake where grated carrots are incorporated 
            into the batter, serving not just as a flavor component but primarily to ensure
             a tender and moist texture. The carrots natural sweetness allows 
             for a moderate amount of added sugar, and the cake's flavor profile is typically 
             dominated by warm spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and sometimes ginger or allspice 
             The base ingredients usually include flour, eggs, sugar, vegetable oil 
             (which further enhances moisture), and baking soda. Common optional add-ins that contribute 
              are pecans, raisins, or shredded coconut.</p>

        <p>The definitive finishing touch that completes the classic carrot cake experience
             is a thick layer of sweet, tangy cream cheese frosting. This smooth, rich topping 
             provides a perfect balance to the spiced, dense crumb of the cake itself. 
             While its exact origins are debated, modern carrot cake gained significant 
             popularity in the United States during the food rationing periods of World War II,
              when home bakers used the readily available and naturally sweet root vegetable 
              as a sugar substitute. It remains a beloved dessert, cherished for its 
              unique combination of texture, spice, and creaminess.</p>
