        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A classic, comforting dish, homemade mac and cheese offers a depth of flavor and
             creaminess that box mixes can rarely match. It typically starts with a rich, velvety cheese sauce,
              known as a mornay sauce, made by incorporating shredded cheese into a
               foundational butter and flour mixture (roux) and milk. Common cheese choices often
                blend a sharp cheddar for flavor with a creamy cheese like Gruyère or Monterey Jack
                 for texture, creating a complex, well-balanced profile. The addition of seasonings
                  like dry mustard powder, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, or a pinch of smoked paprika
                   helps to elevate the savory notes, making each bite more satisfying than the last.</p>
