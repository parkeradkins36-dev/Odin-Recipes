        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A classic, comforting dish, homemade mac and cheese offers a depth of flavor and
             creaminess that box mixes can rarely match. It typically starts with a rich, velvety cheese sauce,
              known as a mornay sauce, made by incorporating shredded cheese into a
               foundational butter and flour mixture (roux) and milk. Common cheese choices often
                blend a sharp cheddar for flavor with a creamy cheese like Gruyère or Monterey Jack
                 for texture, creating a complex, well-balanced profile. The addition of seasonings
                  like dry mustard powder, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, or a pinch of smoked paprika
                   helps to elevate the savory notes, making each bite more satisfying than the last.</p>

        <p>Once the sauce is perfectly smooth and seasoned to taste, it is combined with cooked elbow macaroni.
             Many recipes then transfer this mixture to a baking dish for the final, crucial step: baking.
              A topping of buttery breadcrumbs, crushed crackers, or an extra layer of shredded cheese bakes into a golden-brown,
               crispy crust that provides a delightful textural contrast to the soft, luscious pasta underneath.
                The result is a warm, bubbly, and deeply satisfying dish that serves as the ultimate comfort food,
                 perfect for family dinners, potlucks, or a cozy night in</p>

        <h2>Cooking instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat and Prep: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Cook Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the macaroni for 
                about 1 minute less than the package directions for al dente, 
                as it will continue to cook in the oven. Drain and toss with 
                a small drizzle of olive oil or a tablespoon of butter to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Make the Roux: In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, melt 5 tablespoons of the butter
                 over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, salt, pepper, and paprika. Cook, whisking constantly,
                  for about 1-2 minutes until the mixture is lightly golden and smells slightly toasted.</li>
            <li>Add Dairy: Slowly pour in the milk and heavy cream, a little at a time, whisking
                 constantly until the mixture is smooth and lump-free. Continue cooking and whisking over medium heat
                  until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Melt the Cheese: Remove the saucepan from the heat. Gradually stir in 4 cups 
                of the shredded cheddar and all of the Gruyère cheese until completely melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine and Layer: Add the cooked pasta to the cheese sauce and stir to combine fully.
                 Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish.
                  Sprinkle with the remaining 2 cups of shredded cheddar.
                   Top with the rest of the mac and cheese mixture.</li> 
            <li>Add Topping and Bake: In a small bowl,
                 combine the panko breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese,
                  and the remaining 1 tablespoon of melted butter.
                   Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the top of the mac and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 20-30 minutes,
                 or until the cheese is bubbly and the topping is golden brown.
                  Let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
