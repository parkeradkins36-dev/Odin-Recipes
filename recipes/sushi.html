        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> sushi is a Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice combined with various ingredients 
            like seafood (often raw) and vegetables. It has evolved from an ancient Southeast Asian 
            method of preserving fish in fermented rice, which was introduced to Japan centuries ago.
             The word "sushi" actually refers to the rice, not the fish. Common traditional forms include nigiri
              (hand-pressed rice topped with fish), maki (rolled rice and fillings in seaweed),
               and chirashi (a bowl of scattered rice and toppings).</p>

        <p>sushi is prepared and served with an emphasis on artistry, featuring a harmony of
             simple yet fresh ingredients. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari)
              to cleanse the palate, wasabi, and soy sauce for dipping, though it's customary
               to dip the fish side, not the rice, to prevent it from absorbing too much sauce.
                Traditionally, the chef adds the appropriate amount of wasabi
                 and the sushi is eaten by hand or with chopsticks in one or two bites. </p> 
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Uncooked short-grain sushi rice.</li>
            <li>Thinly sliced sushi-grade fish, tuna or salmon.</li>
            <li>Cucumber or avocado</li>
            <li>Nori (roasted seaweed sheets)</li>
            <li>Water.</li>
            <li>Rice vinegar.</li>
            <li>Sugar.</li>
            <li>Salt.</li>
            <li>Soy sauce.(optional)</li>
            <li>Wasabi.(optional)</li>
            <li>pickled ginger.(optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparing the sushi rice</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice: Place the uncooked rice in a bowl and rinse
                 repeatedly with cold water until the water runs clear. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Cook the rice: Cook the rice in a rice cooker or saucepan according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>Prepare the sushi vinegar: While the rice cooks, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a 
                small, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds or heat gently in a small pot until the sugar and salt are fully dissolved.</li>
            <li>Mix the rice: Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large, non-metallic bowl
                 or a traditional wooden tub (hangiri). Pour the vinegar mixture evenly over the hot rice.
                  Use a cutting motion with a rice paddle (shamoji) to mix the vinegar in,
                   rather than mashing the grains. Simultaneously, fan the rice to cool it down quickly</li>
            <li>Cool: Continue fanning until the rice has cooled to room temperature. Cover it with a damp cloth until ready to use.</li>                
        </ol>
        <h2>Assembling the Maki Rolls</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set up: Lay a bamboo sushi rolling mat (makisu) on a clean surface. Place one sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the mat</li>
            <li>Spread the rice: Moisten your hands with water (this prevents sticking). Take a
                 small scoop of prepared sushi rice and spread it evenly over the nori, leaving a small border (about 1 cm) at the top edge</li>
            <li>Add fillings: Arrange your chosen fillings in a horizontal line across the center of the rice.</li>
            <li>Roll the sushi: Lift the edge of the bamboo mat closest to you and fold it over
                 the fillings, applying firm, even pressure. Continue rolling the mat forward,
                  pulling the loose end of the nori tightly over the roll as you go, until it is fully rolled.</li>
            <li>Cut the roll: Use a sharp, damp knife to slice the long roll into 6-8 individual pieces.</li>
            <li>Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger to taste or eat plain</li>           
        </ol>
