        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> sushi is a Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice combined with various ingredients 
            like seafood (often raw) and vegetables. It has evolved from an ancient Southeast Asian 
            method of preserving fish in fermented rice, which was introduced to Japan centuries ago.
             The word "sushi" actually refers to the rice, not the fish. Common traditional forms include nigiri
              (hand-pressed rice topped with fish), maki (rolled rice and fillings in seaweed),
               and chirashi (a bowl of scattered rice and toppings). </p>
               
        <p>sushi is prepared and served with an emphasis on artistry, featuring a harmony of
             simple yet fresh ingredients. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari)
              to cleanse the palate, wasabi, and soy sauce for dipping, though it's customary
               to dip the fish side, not the rice, to prevent it from absorbing too much sauce.
                Traditionally, the chef adds the appropriate amount of wasabi
                 and the sushi is eaten by hand or with chopsticks in one or two bites. </p>
